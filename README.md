  ### 👩🏻‍🎓 I'm a Silesian University of Technology Informatics student from Poland.
- ✈️ I belong to Scientific Academic Association "High Flyers", where I work on various drone projects and learn many new things
- 💻 I'm working on many studies projects, mostly focusing on C#. You'll find them on GitHub!
- 📚 Informatics is my main hobby, but I also have many more!

 ### ✏️ Projects I took part in
- 🦆 BrainRot Game: 
3D game on Unity Engine programmed in C# for "Computer Graphics" course of my studies. I act as a full-stack developer, making whole design, code, 3D models, 2D drawings and animations. Game is currently at last phase of development and it will work both on Windows and Android devices.
- 📖 Library Manager: 
WPF app made for "Database Systems and Applications" course in a group of 6 people. I am responsible for custom controls and WPF windows. Currently still in development.
- 🤳🏻 Photo Management App: 
Big 9-person project aiming to make an Instagram-like app with many functionalities that will work on both web, desktop and mobile devices. I'm developing an Android app in Java, still in progress.

### 🔎 What am I interested in?
- ⌨️ Proggramming, of course! I believe code gives us endless possibilities of expressing ourselves and making our lives better. I want to focus on C#, WPF and .NET technologies, but I may also use others. I always wanted to make indie games or work for game development company, and for that I use Unity.
- 🎨 Computer graphics. I've made a lot of drawings, 3D models and animations as small hobby projects. You can see them on my yt channel.
- 🚄 Trains. They are fast, they carry enormous amount of loads, they may be ecological and they are just beautiful.
- 🛫 Aerospace engineering. Is there anything more majestic than A380 taking off at sunset? I've been interested in space rockets for so long time, I even run a thematic discord server!
- 🌌 Astrophysics. I've been reading popular science books about that since I can remember and I still never get bored by it.
